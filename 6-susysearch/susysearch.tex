\chapter{Searching for Supersymmetry in the Single Lepton Channel at CMS}
\section{Introduction}
The \PW polarisation measurement, as well as being an interesting analysis in
its own right, also finds application to searches for \acl{NP}. The first of
these, comes from a more complete understanding of the \MET distribution in
\Wjets events - an important background to many \ac{SUSY} searches. The second,
is that the \LP variable itself is able to separate \ac{SM} and \ac{NP} events.
