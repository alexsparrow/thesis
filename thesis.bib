                  distributions of the lepton pair arising from the decay of a W
                  or Z boson produced at high transverse momentum in hadronic
                  collisions is presented. In the absence of cuts on the final
                  state leptons, the lepton angular distribution in the gauge
                  boson rest frame is determined by the gauge boson
                  polarization. Numerical results for the lepton angular
                  distributions in the {Collins-Soper} frame with acceptance
                  cuts and energy resolution smearing applied to the leptons are
                  presented. In the presence of cuts, the lepton angular
                  distributions are dominated by kinematic effects rather than
                  polarization effects; however, some polarization effects are
                  still observable on top of the kinematic effects. Polarization
                  effects are highlighted when the experimental distributions
                  are divided by the Monte Carlo distributions obtained using
                  isotropic gauge boson decay.},

	abstract = {This document proposes a collection of simplified models
                  relevant to the design of new-physics searches at the {LHC}
                  and the characterization of their results. Both {ATLAS} and
                  {CMS} have already presented some results in terms of
                  simplified models, and we encourage them to continue and
                  expand this effort, which supplements both signature-based
                  results and benchmark model interpretations. A simplified
                  model is defined by an effective Lagrangian describing the
                  interactions of a small number of new particles. Simplified
                  models can equally well be described by a small number of
                  masses and cross-sections. These parameters are directly
                  related to collider physics observables, making simplified
                  models a particularly effective framework for evaluating
                  searches and a useful starting point for characterizing
                  positive signals of new physics. This document serves as an
                  official summary of the results from the {"Topologies} for
                  Early {LHC} Searches" workshop, held at {SLAC} in September of
                  2010, the purpose of which was to develop a set of
                  representative models that can be used to cover all relevant
                  phase space in experimental searches. Particular emphasis is
                  placed on searches relevant for the first
                  {\textasciitilde}50-500 pb-1 of data and those motivated by
                  supersymmetric models. This note largely summarizes material
                  posted at http://lhcnewphysics.org/, which includes simplified
                  model definitions, Monte Carlo material, and supporting
                  contacts within the theory community. We also comment on
                  future developments that may be useful as more data is
                  gathered and analyzed by the experiments.},

  abstract={Low energy supersymmetric models provide a solution to the hierarchy
                  problem and also have the necessary ingredients to solve two
                  of the most outstanding issues in cosmology: the origin of the
                  baryon asymmetry and the source of dark matter. In the MSSM,
                  weak scale generation of the baryon asymmetry may be achieved
                  in the presence of light stops, with masses lower than about
                  130 GeV. Moreover, the proper dark matter density may be
                  obtained in the stop-neutralino co-annihilation region, where
                  the stop-neutralino mass difference is smaller than a few tens
                  of GeV. Searches for scalar top quarks (stops) in pair
                  production processes at the Tevatron and at the Large Hadron
                  Collider (LHC) become very challenging in this region of
                  parameters. At the LHC, however, light stops proceeding from
                  the decay of gluino pairs may be identified, provided the
                  gluino mass is smaller than about 900 GeV. In this article we
                  propose an alternative method for stop searches in the
                  co-annihilation region, based on the search for these
                  particles in events with missing energy plus one hard photon
                  or jet. We show that this method is quite efficient and, when
                  complemented with ongoing Tevatron searches, allows to probe
                  stop masses up to about 160 GeV, fully probing the region of
                  parameters consistent with electroweak baryogenesis in the
                  MSSM.}

  abstract={The CMS detector at the LHC is equipped with a high precision
                  electromagnetic crystal calorimeter (ECAL). The crystals
                  undergo a transparency change when exposed to radiation during
                  LHC operation, which recovers in absence of irradiation on the
                  time scale of hours. This change of the crystal response is
                  monitored with a laser system which performs a transparency
                  measurement of each crystal every twenty minutes. The
                  monitoring data is analyzed on a PC farm attached to the
                  central data acquisition system of CMS. After analyzing the
                  raw data, a reduced data set is stored in the Online Master
                  Data Base (OMDS) which is connected to the online computing
                  infrastructure of CMS. The data stored in OMDS, representing
                  the largest data set stored in OMDS for ECAL, contains all the
                  necessary information to perform detailed crystal response
                  monitoring, as well as an analysis of the dynamics of the
                  transparency change. For the CMS physics event data
                  reconstruction, only a reduced set of information from the
                  transparency measurement is required. This data is stored in
                  the Off-line Reconstruction Conditions Database Off-line
                  subset (ORCOFF). To transfer the data from the OMDS to ORCOFF,
                  the reduced data is transferred to Off-line Reconstruction
                  Conditions DB On-line subset (ORCON) in a procedure known as
                  Online to Offline transfer, which includes various checks for
                  data consistency. In this talk we describe the laser
                  monitoring work flow and the specifics of the database usage
                  for the ECAL laser monitoring system. The strategy implemented
                  to optimize the data transfer and to perform quality checks is
                  being presented.}

  abstract={The k t and Cambridge/Aachen inclusive jet finding algorithms for hadron-hadron collisions can be seen as belonging to a broader class of sequential recombination jet algorithms, parametrised by the power of the energy scale in the distance measure. We examine some properties of a new member of this class, for which the power is negative. This ``anti- k t '' algorithm essentially behaves like an idealised cone algorithm, in that jets with only soft fragmentation are conical, active and passive areas are equal, the area anomalous dimensions are zero, the non-global logarithms are those of a rigid boundary and the Milan factor is universal. None of these properties hold for existing sequential recombination algorithms, nor for cone algorithms with split-merge steps, such as SISCone. They are however the identifying characteristics of the collinear unsafe plain ``iterative cone'' algorithm, for which the anti- k t algorithm provides a natural, fast, infrared and collinear safe replacement.}

  abstract={The bremsstrahlung energy loss distribution of electrons propagating in matter is highly non-Gaussian. Because the Kalman filter relies solely on Gaussian probability density functions, it is not necessarily the optimal reconstruction algorithm for electron tracks. A Gaussian-sum filter (GSF) algorithm for electron reconstruction in the CMS tracker has therefore been developed and implemented. The basic idea is to model the bremsstrahlung energy loss distribution by a Gaussian mixture rather than by a single Gaussian. It is shown that the GSF is able to improve the momentum resolution of electrons compared to the standard Kalman filter. The momentum resolution and the quality of the error estimate are studied both with a fast simulation, modelling the radiative energy loss in a simplified detector, and the full CMS tracker simulation.}

  abstract={We present the latest developments of the MadGraph/MadEvent Monte Carlo event generator and several applications to hadron collider physics. In the current version events at the parton, hadron and detector level can be generated directly from a web interface, for arbitrary processes in the Standard Model and in several physics scenarios beyond it (HEFT, MSSM, 2HDM). The most important additions are: a new framework for implementing user-defined new physics models; a standalone running mode for creating and testing matrix elements; generation of events corresponding to different processes, such as signal(s) and backgrounds, in the same run; two platforms for data analysis, where events are accessible at the parton, hadron and detector level; and the generation of inclusive multi-jet samples by combining parton-level events with parton showers. To illustrate the new capabilities of the package some applications to hadron collider physics are presented: I. Higgs search in pp → H → W + W − : signal and backgrounds. II. Higgs CP properties: pp → Hjj in the HEFT. III. Spin of a new resonance from lepton angular distributions. IV. Single-top and Higgs associated production in a generic 2HDM. V. Comparison of strong SUSY pair production at the SPS points. VI. Inclusive W +jets matched samples: comparison with Tevatron data.}

The physics is then not understood well enough to give an exact description; instead the program has to be based on a combination of analytical results and various QCD-based models. This physics input is summarized here, for areas such as hard subprocesses, initial- and final-state parton showers, underlying events and beam remnants, fragmentation and decays, and much more. Furthermore, extensive information is provided on all program elements: subroutines and functions, switches and parameters, and particle and process data. This should allow the user to tailor the generation task to the topics of interest. The code and further information may be found on the Pythia web page: http://www.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html [http://www.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html] .}

  abstract={I describe a framework for the presentation of search results which is motivated by frequentist statistics. The most well-known use of this framework is for the combined search for the Higgs boson at LEP. A toy neutrino oscillations experiment is used to illustrate the rich information available in the framework for exclusion and discovery. I argue that the so-called CL s technique for setting limits is appropriate for determining exclusion intervals while the determination of confidence intervals advocated by Feldman and Cousins' method is more appropriate for treating established signals, i.e. going beyond discovery to measurement.

  abstract={This biennial Review summarizes much of particle physics. Using data from previous editions, plus 2158 new measurements from 551 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We also summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as Higgs bosons, heavy neutrinos, and supersymmetric particles. All the particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We also give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as the Standard Model, particle detectors, probability, and statistics. Among the 108 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised including those on neutrino mass, mixing, and oscillations, QCD, top quark, CKM quark-mixing matrix, V ud & V us , V cb & V ub , fragmentation functions, particle detectors for accelerator and non-accelerator physics, magnetic monopoles, cosmological parameters, and big bang cosmology. A booklet is available containing the Summary Tables and abbreviated versions of some of the other sections of this full Review . All tables, listings, and reviews (and errata) are also available on the Particle Data Group website: pdg.lbl.gov [http://pdg.lbl.gov] .}
