                  distributions of the lepton pair arising from the decay of a W
                  or Z boson produced at high transverse momentum in hadronic
                  collisions is presented. In the absence of cuts on the final
                  state leptons, the lepton angular distribution in the gauge
                  boson rest frame is determined by the gauge boson
                  polarization. Numerical results for the lepton angular
                  distributions in the {Collins-Soper} frame with acceptance
                  cuts and energy resolution smearing applied to the leptons are
                  presented. In the presence of cuts, the lepton angular
                  distributions are dominated by kinematic effects rather than
                  polarization effects; however, some polarization effects are
                  still observable on top of the kinematic effects. Polarization
                  effects are highlighted when the experimental distributions
                  are divided by the Monte Carlo distributions obtained using
                  isotropic gauge boson decay.},

	title = {Simplified Models for {LHC} New Physics Searches},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.2838},
	abstract = {This document proposes a collection of simplified models
                  relevant to the design of new-physics searches at the {LHC}
                  and the characterization of their results. Both {ATLAS} and
                  {CMS} have already presented some results in terms of
                  simplified models, and we encourage them to continue and
                  expand this effort, which supplements both signature-based
                  results and benchmark model interpretations. A simplified
                  model is defined by an effective Lagrangian describing the
                  interactions of a small number of new particles. Simplified
                  models can equally well be described by a small number of
                  masses and cross-sections. These parameters are directly
                  related to collider physics observables, making simplified
                  models a particularly effective framework for evaluating
                  searches and a useful starting point for characterizing
                  positive signals of new physics. This document serves as an
                  official summary of the results from the {"Topologies} for
                  Early {LHC} Searches" workshop, held at {SLAC} in September of
                  2010, the purpose of which was to develop a set of
                  representative models that can be used to cover all relevant
                  phase space in experimental searches. Particular emphasis is
                  placed on searches relevant for the first
                  {\textasciitilde}50-500 pb-1 of data and those motivated by
                  supersymmetric models. This note largely summarizes material
                  posted at http://lhcnewphysics.org/, which includes simplified
                  model definitions, Monte Carlo material, and supporting
                  contacts within the theory community. We also comment on
                  future developments that may be useful as more data is
                  gathered and analyzed by the experiments.},

  abstract={The performance of muon reconstruction in CMS is evaluated using a large data sample of cosmic-ray muons recorded in 2008. Efficiencies of various high-level trigger, identification, and reconstruction algorithms have been measured for a broad range of muon momenta, and were found to be in good agreement with expectations from Monte Carlo simulation. The relative momentum resolution for muons crossing the barrel part of the detector is better than 1% at 10 GeV/ c and is about 8% at 500 GeV/ c , the latter being only a factor of two worse than expected with ideal alignment conditions. Muon charge misassignment ranges from less than 0.01% at 10 GeV/ c to about 1% at 500 GeV/ c .}
