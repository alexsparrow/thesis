The subject of this work has been the search for physics beyond the \ac{SM} - in
particular for \ac{SUSY} or \ac{SUSY} like theories possessing an analogue of
the \ac{LSP}. As has been seen, no deviations from the \ac{SM} have been seen by
this, or other analyses at the LHC. Consequently, limits have been set on a
large class of models: the \ac{CMSSM} and a number of more generic simplified
models.

In addition, the first measurement of the polarisation of \PW bosons with large
transverse momentum at a proton-proton collider has been undertaken. The
expected effect, namely a large dominance of left-handed over right-handed \PW
bosons has been observed with large significance. In addition, the results
appear to agree well with theoretical predictions.
