\chapter{\acl{SUSY}}
\label{sec:susy}
The \ac{SM} describes all the known fundamental particles and interactions to an
incredible degree of accuracy. What cause is there to believe that there might
be physical phenomena not described by this theory? This will be the topic we
now turn to.

\section{Limitations of the \acl{SM}}
\label{sec:susy_limitations_sm}
A limitation of the \ac{SM}, which is readily apparent, is that it makes no
attempt to unify gravity with the other fundamental forces. From a purely
experimental perspective, this is not an issue, since no experiment is able to
explore gravitational effects at the quantum scale. This is unlikely to change
in the foreseeable future. However, it seems clear to many theorists that a
quantised theory of gravity must exist, and indeed this has been the focus of
great theoretical effort over the last thirty years. Several potential theories
have emerged, aiming to provide an entirely unified picture of fundamental
physics; two examples being \emph{string theory}~\cite{string_theory} and
\emph{loop quantum gravity}~\cite{loop_quantum}. Whilst proponents of these
theories have been criticised for devising untestable hypotheses, it seems
certain that some \ac{NP} must be present to give a more unified physical
theory.

It should be noted that the \ac{SM}, as initially formulated, is unable to
account for the phenomenon of \emph{neutrino oscillation}~\cite{pdg} --
transitions in flight between the neutrino flavour eigenstates (\Pnue, \Pnum and
\Pnut). Neutrino oscillation, first observed in solar and atmospheric
neutrinos~\cite{neutrino_osc,neutrino_osc_discovery}, indicates that neutrinos
are massive -- a property not incorporated into the \ac{SM}. There are a number
of extensions to the \ac{SM} proposed to explain this observation, the simplest
of which introduces a set of right-handed neutrino fields~\cite{pdg}.

\subsection{The Hierarchy Problem}
The \emph{hierarchy problem} is arguably one of the strongest theoretical
arguments for physics beyond the \ac{SM}. This relates to the apparently huge
difference between the weak mass scale, \Mweak, and the \emph{Planck scale} of
gravity, \Mplanck -- over 16 orders of magnitude. To some, it seems unthinkable
that no new physics should appear in this vast range of
energies~\cite{susy_primer}.

As well as being aesthetically undesirable, the hierarchy problem presents a
real theoretical issue for the mass of the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson mass
receives quantum corrections from every particle that it couples to -- directly
or indirectly. These corrections have the form~\cite{sparticles,susy_primer},
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:higgs_mass}
\Delta \mHiggs^2 = -\frac{\left|\lambda_f\right|^2}{8\pi^2}\LambdaUV^2 + \ldots,
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_f$ is the coupling constant to a fermion $f$ and \LambdaUV is the
momentum cut-off regulating the loop integral. All \ac{SM} fermions can
contribute to this correction, but it is largest for the top quark, where
$\lambda_f \approx 1$. Interpreting $\LambdaUV$ as the scale at which new
physics should appear to alter the behaviour of the theory and taking this to be
the Planck scale, these corrections are found to be 30 orders of magnitude
larger than the expected Higgs mass ($\approx \unit{100}{\GeV}$).

Whilst it might seem possible to just pick a small value of \LambdaUV, this
would require some form of new physics at this scale to alter the propagators in
the loop as well as cutting off the loop integral. As will be seen \ac{SUSY}
provides a neat solution to this problem.

\subsection{Dark Matter}
\label{sec:susy_darkmatter}
The problem of dark matter is perhaps the most convincing argument, at least
to experimentalists, for the existence of some physics beyond the \ac{SM}. It
was observed as early as 1932~\cite{darkmatter_review} that galactic rotation
curves appear to be at odds with those predicted from estimates of their visible
mass. This seems to suggest a great deal of additional mass, or \emph{dark matter},
is present in the galaxy, over and above that which can be inferred by direct
observation. This observation is confirmed by measurements of gravitational
lensing~\cite{bullet_cluster} and mapping of the cosmic microwave
background~\cite{wmap_7year}. Current observations suggest dark matter comprises
about 80\%~\cite[Table 8]{wmap_7year} of the matter content of the universe. No
experimentally confirmed theory is able to explain this.

One possible explanation is that the universe is populated with
massive particles that interact only via the weak force (and
gravity). These \acp{WIMP} would therefore be invisible. Experiments
hoping to directly detect such a particle have been underway for some
time. Typically, these employ a large volume of a suitable gas or
liquid, in the hope that passing \acp{WIMP} will undergo a nuclear
interaction which may then be detected. Whilst some experiments have
claimed discoveries, the evidence is not yet believed to be
conclusive~\cite{dama_libra}.

A related issue is that of \emph{dark energy} -- believed to constitute nearly
three-quarters of the mass-energy content of the
universe~\cite{wmap_7year}. Like dark matter, this also has no basis in
currently accepted theories of particle physics. Taken together, these phenomena
are strong evidence of physics beyond the \ac{SM}.

\section{Beyond the \acl{SM}}
Having provided some motivation for looking beyond the \ac{SM} towards a more
complete theory, one might ask what sort of new physics might be expected. An
extremely large number of potential theories have been proposed. The majority of
these can be categorised as follows\footnote{This list is not intended to be
  exhaustive but only to highlight a few popular approaches to the problem.}:
\begin{itemize}
\item A shift beyond gauge theories to an entirely new theoretical paradigm;
\item an extension of the \ac{SM} gauge group by an additional symmetry -- either
  by a simple product or by embedding into some larger group or
\item an extension of the symmetry group of spacetime -- the \Poincare group.
\end{itemize}

Examples of the first approach have already been mentioned -- string theory, loop
quantum gravity and numerous others. Nothing further will be said of these
except that, whilst not making predictions which are directly testable by
contemporary experiments, they do, in certain cases, suggest extensions of the
\ac{SM}, which might fit under the second and third categories (for instance in
the case of supersymmetry).

Many attempts have been made to construct a \acl{GUT} using the second
approach. The Georgi-Glashow model, for instance, embeds the \ac{SM} into the
\SUfive group~\cite{georgi_glashow}. This suffers from a number of problems -- in
particular predicting unstable protons -- but is otherwise quite successful as a
description of the \ac{SM}.

Finally, the last kind of extension has also attracted considerable theoretical
interest. Much of this was forever stymied by a so-called ``no go theorem''
published by Coleman and Mandula in 1967~\cite{coleman_mandula}. This
essentially forbids a class of extensions to the \ac{SM} which attempt to
combine the \Poincare group with an additional symmetry beyond just as a simple
product. Put precisely~\cite{sparticles}, the Lie algebra representing the
continuous symmetries of the S-matrix, containing as subalgebras the \Poincare
Lie algebra and some other Lie algebra defined by generators $T^a$ and structure
constants $t^{ab}_c$, must be a direct sum of the two algebras i.e.
\begin{equation*}
\left[T^a, P_{\mu}\right] = \left[T^a, M_{\mu\nu}\right] = 0,
\end{equation*}
where $P_{\mu}$ and $M_{\mu\nu}$ are generators representing translations and
rotations/boosts in the \Poincare group. Commutativity of the generators implies
that the group may be separated into a simple product of two groups.

However, one of the technical requirements of this theorem -- that it applies
exclusively to Lie algebras -- points to a potential escape route. As will be
seen, this limitation allows \acf{SUSY} to neatly sidestep the Coleman-Mandula
theorem and introduce an additional, non-trivial space-time symmetry. The next
section will explain how this is done and, importantly how it solves the issues
introduced in \sec~\ref{sec:susy_limitations_sm}.

\section{\acl{SUSY}}
\subsection{An Additional Symmetry}
The central concept of \ac{SUSY} is to introduce an additional spacetime
symmetry -- one relating bosons and fermions~\cite{sparticles}. At first this
might seem to fall foul of the Coleman-Mandula theorem. It can be seen that this
additional ``supersymmetry'' must be represented by an anti-commuting spinor, \Qa
(where the subscript $a$ is a spinor index). Like other spinors, this has an
anti-spinor, \AQa. The algebra representing this transformation is no longer a
Lie Algebra, which requires commutation relations, but a \emph{Lie superalgebra}
obeying \emph{anti-commutation} relations.

Since supersymmetric theories are not based on a Lie algebra, they do not fall
under the Coleman-Mandula theorem. Instead they are bound by the Haag,
Lopuszanski, Sohnius theorem~\cite{hls_theorem}. This will not be stated explicitly except to say
that it places restrictions on the form of the \ac{SUSY} algebra. These have the
schematic form~\cite{susy_primer}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:susy_commutator}
\left\{Q,Q^{\dagger}\right\} = P^{\mu}\\
\left\{Q,Q\right\} = \left\{Q^{\dagger}, Q^{\dagger}\right\} = 0\\
\left[P^{\mu}, Q\right] = \left[P^{\mu}, Q^{\dagger}\right] = 0,
\end{eqnarray}
where spinor indices have been dropped.

\subsection{Consequences}
\label{sec:consequences}
This seemingly simple addition brings with it a very rich phenomenology. Most
importantly, from the point of view of experimental physics, it predicts a large
number of new particles. Each particle in a supersymmetric theory is paired with
another in a so-called \emph{supermultiplet}. These particles are said to be
\emph{superpartners} of one another and are related by a \ac{SUSY}
transformation.

It can be shown~\cite{susy_primer}, that each supermultiplet must contain an
equal number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. This allows the range
of possible supermultiplets to be enumerated. The simplest supermultiplet
contains a spinor with two fermionic degrees of freedom. This implies that it
should also contain two bosonic degrees of freedom: either as two real scalar
fields or a single complex scalar field. This pairing is known as a \emph{chiral
  supermultiplet}.

Consider next a supermultiplet containing a massless spin 1 boson
(these have two helicity states, and thus two bosonic degrees of
freedom). This must be paired with a single massless spinor with two
fermionic degrees of freedom. It must also be \spinhalf -- a
\spinthreetwo particle would cause renormalisation problems~\cite{susy_primer}. This
pairing is known as a \emph{vector} (or \emph{gauge})
\emph{supermultiplet}.

\ac{SUSY} therefore requires that all \ac{SM} particles be placed into one
of these supermultiplets. Inevitably, this requires the existence of a whole
range of additional particles -- each possessing a spin differing by
$\frac{1}{2}$ from its \ac{SM} counterpart.

In addition to having a certain theoretical elegance, this turns out to address
the major problems pointed out in \sec~\ref{sec:susy_limitations_sm}. Firstly,
it provides a remedy to the hierarchy problem. The additional superpartners also
contribute to the Higgs mass corrections (see \eqn~\ref{eqn:higgs_mass}). In
fact, bosonic and fermionic loops contributing to the correction appear with
opposite signs. \acl{SUSY} therefore causes exact cancellations of these
problematic contributions -- effectively fixing the hierarchy problem.

A certain class of supersymmetric theories also contain a solution to the Dark
Matter puzzle. Such theories contain a \acf{LSP} which appears to match the
characteristics of a \ac{WIMP}.

Finally, another aspect of \ac{SUSY} theories that is often touted as an
advantage, is that they allow the gauge couplings for the electromagnetic, weak
and strong forces to unify at a certain energy scale. The running of the inverse
couplings is shown in \fig~\ref{fig:susy_gauge_unification}.

\subsection[R-Parity]{\Rparity}
When it comes to writing down a supersymmetric Lagrangian, it is possible to
write down terms which violate either Baryon ($B$) or Lepton number ($L$)
conservation. Such terms are forbidden in the \ac{SM} by renormalisability
requirements. $B$ or $L$ violation would imply proton decay times much shorter
than experimental lower limits. In order to prevent such terms from appearing in
the Lagrangian, a new discrete symmetry is supposed, \Rparity.

\Rparity is often considered as a new quantum number possessed by each particle
and multiplicatively conserved,
\begin{equation*}
\PR = \left(-1\right)^{3(B-L)+2s},
\end{equation*}
where $s$ is the spin of the particle. This results in an assignment of $\PR =
1$ to all \ac{SM} particles, and -1 to their superpartners. To ensure this is
conserved, \ac{SUSY} particles may only be pair-produced from \ac{SM}
particles. Each of their decays must also result in an odd number of \ac{SUSY}
particles.

The importance of this becomes clear when one considers the lightest
superpartner in the theory -- the \ac{LSP}. This is unable to decay to a lighter
\ac{SUSY} particle and thus cannot satisfy the requirements of \Rparity
conservation. It is therefore stable and, under certain other assumptions, a
suitable candidate for the \ac{WIMP} hypothesised to solve the Dark Matter
problem.

  threshold varied between \unit{500}{\GeV} and \unit{1.5}{\TeV}, and
  $\alpha_3(m_Z)$ is varied between $0.117$ and $0.121$.~\cite{susy_primer}}
\label{fig:susy_gauge_unification}
\end{figure}

\subsection{\acl{SUSY} Breaking}
Examining the commutator in \eqn~\ref{eqn:susy_commutator}, it is seen that the
\ac{SUSY} generator \Qa commutes with $P^{\mu}$ and hence also with
$P^{\mu}P_{\mu} = m^2$. This requires superpartners to have identical mass -- a
prediction that is clearly at odds with experiment, since no additional
superpartners have so far been observed.

If \ac{SUSY} is to be a symmetry of the universe, some additional mechanism
must be incorporated into the theory to explain these differing masses. Taking
inspiration from \ac{EWSB}, \ac{SUSY} is said to be spontaneously
broken. \ac{SUSY} would therefore be respected by the Lagrangian but not by
the vacuum. This would effectively ``hide'' \ac{SUSY} at lower mass scales
(i.e. those so far explored by experiment). There are a number of proposed
mechanisms for \ac{SUSY} breaking, including: \ac{mSUGRA}~\cite{msugra},
\ac{GMSB}~\cite{gmsb} and \ac{AMSB}~\cite{amsb}.

Having invoked \ac{SUSY} initially as a solution to the hierarchy problem,
it is desirable that the breaking of \ac{SUSY} not prevent the cancellations
which stabilise the Higgs mass. Terms in the Lagrangian which preserve this
property are known as ``soft'' \ac{SUSY}-breaking terms. They are required to
have positive mass dimension~\cite{susy_primer}. Scenarios involving
``non-soft'' \ac{SUSY} breaking will not be considered here.

\section{The \acl{MSSM}}
\label{sec:susy_mssm}
The \acf{MSSM}~\cite{mssm} is a minimal extension of the \ac{SM} to include soft
\ac{SUSY}-breaking terms. Since the mechanism and dynamics of this breaking are
unknown, additional parameters must be introduced into the theory. The \ac{MSSM}
adds 105 additional real constants to the 19 present in the
\ac{SM}~\cite[p.~186]{sparticles}. This proves extraordinarily problematic from
the point of view of experimental \ac{SUSY} searches. In
\chap~\ref{sec:framework}, it will be shown how simplified models can offer a
much simpler context for interpretation of results.

\subsection{Particle Content}
We shall now discuss the particle content of the \ac{MSSM}, a summary of which
is presented in Tables~\ref{tbl:susy_particles} and \ref{tbl:susy_gauginos}. The
basic forms of the allowed supermultiplets were discussed in
\sec~\ref{sec:consequences}. Each fermion in the \ac{SM} is placed into a chiral
supermultiplet with a \spinzero \emph{sfermion}. These are written with a tilde,
e.g. $\PSe_L$ for the \emph{selectron}. Left-handed and right-handed components
must lie in separate chiral supermultiplets. It is important to note that the
subscripts on the sfermions indicate the chirality of the \emph{partner
  fermion}. Being \spinzero bosons, the sfermions are not chiral.

Similarly the \ac{SM} gauge bosons are placed into gauge supermultiplets. The
corresponding superpartners are referred to generically as \emph{gauginos} or more
specifically as \emph{Winos}, \emph{Bino} and \emph{gluinos}. Electroweak symmetry
breaking (see \sec~\ref{sec:theory_ewsb}) leads to mixing of the gauge
eigenstates $\PW^0$ and $\PB^0$ to give the $\PZ$ and $\Pphoton$. The corresponding
combinations of superpartners are known as the Zino (\PSZ) and Photino
($\PSphotino$) respectively.

One might expect the Higgs field to be placed into a single chiral
supermultiplet with a \spinhalf superpartner. This turns out not to be possible
for two reasons. Firstly, for reasons beyond the scope of this discussion, such
a theory would suffer a gauge anomaly after quantisation. Secondly, the
structure of the Yukawa couplings (see \sec~\ref{sec:theory_yukawa}) actually
requires two Higgs supermultiplets to give mass to up and down type quarks. The
complex scalar doublets with hypercharge, $Y=\pm\frac{1}{2}$ will be referred to
as $\PHiggs_u$ and $\PHiggs_d$ respectively. The weak isospin components of
these are then $\PHiggs_u^+$, $\PHiggs_u^0$, $\PHiggs_d^0$ and $\PHiggs_d^-$
where the superscript indicates electric charge.

The fermionic superpartners of each Higgs field, the Higgsinos, are then denoted
$\PSHiggs_u$ and $\PSHiggs_d$. The physical \ac{SM} Higgs is taken to be a
linear combination of the neutral components $\PHiggs_u^0$ and $\PHiggs_d^0$.

\input{tables/susy_particles}
\input{tables/susy_gauginos}

\subsection{Neutralinos and Charginos}
\ac{EWSB} leads to mixing of the charged and neutral \spinhalf
superpartners. The four mass eigenstates formed from the charged
gauginos and Higgsinos are known as \emph{charginos}. They are
composed of the charged Higgsinos ($\PSHiggs_u^+$, $\PSHiggs_d^-$) and
Winos ($\PSWpm$). The four chargino states are denoted
$\PScharginopm_i$ for $i=1,2$. Similarly the neutral Higgsinos
($\PSHiggs_u^0$, $\PSHiggs_d^0$), Wino ($\PSW^0$) and Bino ($\PSB^0$)
mix to give four \emph{neutralinos}. These will be denoted
$\PSneutralino_i$ where $i=1,2,3,4$. The lightest of these will be
denoted \PSneutralino, the \ac{LSP}. This is often taken to be the
dark matter candidate referred to in \sec~\ref{sec:consequences}.

\section{\acl{SUSY} Searches}
Since the emergence of \ac{SUSY} in the 1970s, a number of particle physics
experiments have undertaken dedicated searches for evidence of supersymmetric
particles. These collider or fixed-target experiments have sought to produce
supersymmetric particles in high-energy collisions -- so far without
success~\cite{ua1_susy,aleph_susy,d0_susy,hera_susy}. As discussed in
\sec~\ref{sec:susy_darkmatter}, dedicated searches have also been performed
specifically for ``\ac{WIMP}-like'' Dark Matter signals. The detection
experiments will not be discussed further here, except to say that they offer a
highly complementary path to the discovery of Dark
Matter~\cite{mastercode_2011}.

In this section, the constraints set by previous \ac{SUSY} searches will be
summarised. This will naturally motivate discussion of the experimental
signatures of \ac{SUSY} particles. Finally, the signatures most relevant for
searches at the \ac{LHC} will be presented -- in particular the single lepton
channel that is the basis for the search described in
\chap~\ref{sec:susysearch}.

\subsection{\acl{SUSY} at Colliders}
Useful experimental signatures of \ac{SUSY} at colliders depend greatly on
whether \Rparity is assumed as a conserved quantity. Since, conservation of
\Rparity predicts the existence of a \ac{WIMP} and ensures a stable proton, it
is often assumed by experimental searches. \Rparity violating theories are the
subject of theoretical~\cite{aulakh_rpv} and experimental work but will not be
discussed further here.

As stated previously, \Rparity conservation predicts the existence of a stable
\ac{LSP} or \ac{WIMP}. Being weakly interacting, this will not be directly
detected at a collider experiment but is observable as a deficit of energy in
the detector -- a so-called missing energy signature. This signal forms the basis
of the majority of collider \ac{SUSY} searches. In addition to one or more
\acp{LSP}, \ac{SUSY} decays typically result in a large number of \ac{SM}
particles.

Whilst missing energy offers a relatively clean experimental signature, \ac{SM}
backgrounds with a missing energy component may be rejected by making further
selection on the final state particles in an event. These backgrounds may
contain genuine missing energy signal, in the form of a \ac{SM} neutrino, or be
the result of detector mismeasurement -- a ``fake'' signal. Additional
requirements often exploit other features of \ac{SUSY} particle
production. Suitable choices will depend on the dominant \ac{SUSY} production
processes and therefore on the nature of the colliding particles
e.g. $\APelectron\Pelectron$, $\Pproton\APproton$, $\Pproton\Pproton$. In other
cases, such additional requirements may focus sensitivity on a more specific
class of \ac{SUSY} models.

\subsubsection{$\APelectron\Pelectron$ Colliders}
All sparticles (excluding the gluino) may be produced in tree-level processes at
$\Pelectron\APelectron$ colliders~\cite{susy_primer}. The \ac{LEP} experiment
which ran up to centre-of-mass energies of \unit{209}{\GeV} has excluded all
charged sparticles up to masses of approximately half this energy. If the mass
splitting between a given sparticle and the \ac{LSP} is assumed to be smaller,
the detection efficiency becomes worse and these limits become weaker.

Take as an example the pair-production of charginos. The charginos
subsequently decay to the \ac{LSP} in association with either: four jets, two
jets and 1 lepton, or two leptons of opposite charge~\cite{sparticles}. Searches
at \ac{LEP} set a limit of $m_{\PScharginopm} > \unit{103}{\GeV}$ (or weaker if
the mass difference between chargino and \ac{LSP} is in the range
$\unit{100}{\MeV} < m_{\PScharginopm} - m_{\PSneutralinoOne} <
\unit{3}{\GeV}$~\cite{susy_primer}).

\subsubsection{Hadron Colliders}
At hadron colliders, production of charginos, neutralinos, sleptons and
sneutrinos is possible via electroweak processes. Production of squarks and
gluinos is also possible, and has ``\ac{QCD}-strength''
coupling~\cite{sparticles}. At Fermilab's Tevatron accelerator, squark and
gluino production were initially expected to dominate. However, once the
low-mass region had been excluded, chargino and neutralino production became the
focus of searches. Likewise, at the \ac{LHC}, $\Psquark\Psquark$,
$\PSgluino\PSgluino$ or $\Psquark\PSgluino$ production are presumed to dominate.

\Rparity requires that sparticles be pair produced. Each proceeds via a cascade
decay to the \ac{LSP}. The cascade will generally produce a number of jets and
possibly leptons. This covers most typical \ac{SUSY} topologies studied at
hadron colliders.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig/susy_1lep}
\caption[\acs{SUSY} decay chain leading to a single lepton final state]{Diagram
  showing a possible \ac{SUSY} decay chain beginning with gluino pair-production
  and leading to a single lepton final state.}
\label{fig:susy_1lep_decay}
\end{figure}

One such cascade decay is shown in \fig~\ref{fig:susy_1lep_decay}. This would be
a typical cascade decay leading to a single-lepton final state. Whilst being
less inclusive than the pure jets plus missing energy signature, the addition of
a lepton requirement serves to significantly suppress the experimental
background from \ac{QCD} events~\cite{msugra_signals}. With additional kinematic
requirements imposed, this channel is sensitive to a range of \ac{SUSY}
scenarios. A search based on this final state will be presented in
\chap~\ref{sec:susysearch}.
