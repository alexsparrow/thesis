cap=\PW polarisation fit results for a number of closure tests,
caption=Fit results for the helicity fractions, $f_{L}^{\pm}$ and $f_{R}^{\pm}$
for several closure tests of the reweighting method described in
\sec~\ref{sec:wpol_reweighting}. The results of an analytical fit to the
$\cos\thetastar$ distribution\, having applied reconstruction level cuts on the
\PW boson\, are shown in the first column. The second column shows results from fits to the
\LP distribution at generator level in the muon channel. The final two columns
show the results of a full\, reconstruction-level closure test in both lepton
channels. The uncertainties have not been included for the reconstruction-level
muon fit since it is seen to close within the uncertanties of the analytical
fit.,
