A number of software tools were vital to the production of this thesis. The
author is extremely grateful to the many individiuals responsible. Without such
high-quality tools, this work would simply not have been possible.

The thesis was written using the \textsc{Emacs} text-editor and typeset with
\TeX/\LaTeX. The \texttt{git} version control system was invaluable for
maintaining backups and managing changes.

All work was performed using the \textsc{GNU/Linux} operating system, primarily
the variant assembled by the volunteers of the \textsc{Arch Linux} project. Much
of the code was written using the \textsc{Python} programming language. Whilst
some plots were produced using the \textsc{ROOT} framework, the author prefers
\texttt{matplotlib} for its superior API and powerful features. The
\textsc{XMonad} tiling window manager provided a huge productivity boon.
