* STUFF
** TODO Mention equivalence theorem in wpol section
** TODO Acceptance correction in wpol section
** TODO Combined fit
** TODO Ensure that I've properly set out that we are fitting f0 and fL - fR
** TODO Ensure fitting section is accurate
** DONE Wpol section. Mention that instead of choosing a variable correlated to costheta*, one may also pick one of the two solutions in pz.

** Would be nice to have the JEC uncertainty ratios for electrons too
** Would be nice to have some diagrams illustrating the QCD kinematics
