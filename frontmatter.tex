  This thesis gives an account of two analyses performed using data from the
  \acl{CMS} experiment at the \acl{LHC}. The first analysis measures the
  polarisation of \PW bosons with large transverse momentum using
  \unit{36}{\invpb} of data collected in 2010. The second applies similar
  techniques to a search for supersymmetry in events containing a single lepton,
  jets and missing transverse energy. This analysis utilises \unit{1.1}{\invfb}
  of data collected up to 2011. Background material related to the \acl{SM},
  supersymmetry and the experimental apparatus are reviewed in detail.

  The \PW polarisation measurement is performed in both the
  $\PW\longrightarrow\Pe\Pneutrino$ and $\PW\longrightarrow\Pmu\Pneutrino$
  channels. The expected effect, a large dominance of the left-handed over the
  right-handed helicity state, is observed with a significance of $7.8\sigma$
  for the \PWp and $5.1\sigma$ for the \PWm in the muon channel. Similar results
  are found in the electron channel and for a combined fit to both lepton
  channels.

  The second analysis conducts a search for supersymmetry in events containing a
  single lepton, jets and missing transverse energy. The search employs
  techniques developed for the \PW polarisation measurement to separate
  supersymmetry from Standard Model backgrounds. No deviation from the Standard
  Model is observed. A detailed statistical interpretation is performed and used
  to set limits within the \acl{CMSSM} as well as two simplified models.

  This dissertation is the result of my own work, except where explicit
  reference is made to the work of others, and has not been submitted
  for another qualification to this or any other university.

  The work presented in \chaps~\ref{sec:wpol}, \ref{sec:susysearch} and
  \ref{sec:interpretation} is the result of collaboration with a number of
  others. For completeness and necessary context, I have presented a full
  account of these analyses. For the \PW polarisation measurement, my
  contributions were primarily to the electron channel and the fitting
  procedure. For the supersymmetry search, I worked mainly on estimating the
  systematic uncertainties and optimising the selection cuts. I also set
  up the statistical procedure detailed in Appendix~\ref{sec:inter_1lepton} and
  performed the interpretation and validation work shown in
  \chap~\ref{sec:interpretation}.

  \acused{CERN} I would firstly like to thank my direct collaborators at
  \ac{CERN} and Imperial College. To Georgia Karapostoli for all of her help and
  advice, particularly in helping me to get started on this work. To Markus
  Stoye, Jad Marrouche and Loukas Gouskos for providing so much helpful input
  and fixing so many of my mistakes. Finally, to Oliver Buchm\"{u}ller and Paris
  Sphicas for their continuous oversight on both analyses and for steering the
  ship through so many storms.

  There are many others deserving of thanks for their continuous support and
  advice. First and foremost to my immediate colleagues at \ac{CERN}: Arlo
  Guneratne Bryer, Michael Cutajar, Zoe Hatherell, Martyn Jarvis, Bryn Mathias,
  Robin Nandi and Nick Wardle for their unending advice, good humour and
  inspiration. Particular thanks to John Jones for the \susyv2 code and many
  interesting discussions. I am also grateful to Burt Betchart and Ted Laird for
  their many technical contributions.

  At Imperial College, I'd like to thank Costas Foudas for supervising my
  Masters project and for encouraging me to start a PhD in the first place.  I
  should also like to thank my supervisor Alex Tapper, who has been immensely
  supportive and helpful throughout my PhD.

  The last few years have been among the most enjoyable of my life. This is
  thanks, in no small part, to a number of great friends. Happily, several are
  among the colleagues already mentioned. I should like to thank the many
  others, in Bath, London and Geneva. In particular, to Paul Schaack for being
  an excellent friend, housemate and colleague. But most of all, to Kitty Liao
  for her tireless help and support and for putting up with me for so long.

  Finally, to my family. To my two sisters, Maddie and Lydia, for so many happy
  times. Above all, to my parents, Pauline and Timothy, who taught me the value
  of education. For encouraging me to pursue my dreams and for supporting me
  unwaveringly at every step along the way.
