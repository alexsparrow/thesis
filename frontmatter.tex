%% Declaration
\begin{declaration}
  This dissertation is the result of my own work, except where explicit
  reference is made to the work of others, and has not been submitted
  for another qualification to this or any other university.

  The work presented in Chapters~\ref{sec:wpol}, \ref{sec:susysearch},
  \ref{sec:interpretation} is the result of collaboration with a number of
  others. For completeness and necessary context, I have presented a full
  account of these analyses. For the \PW polarisation measurement, my
  contributions were primarily to the electron channel measurement and the
  fitting procedure. For the supersymmetry search, I worked mostly on the
  estimation of the systematic uncertainties and optimising some of the
  selection cuts. I also set up the statistics procedure detailed in
  Appendix~\ref{sec:inter_1lepton} and performed the interpretation and
  validation work shown in Chapter~\ref{sec:interpretation}.

  each moment, because it will never come again. What we leave behind is not as
  important as how we have lived.}%
