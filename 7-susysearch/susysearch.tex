\chapter{Searching for Supersymmetry in the Single Lepton Final State}
\label{sec:susysearch}
\section{Introduction}
The \PW polarisation measurement, as well as being an interesting analysis in
its own right, also finds application in searches for \acf{NP}. First of all, it
provides a more complete understanding of the \MET distribution in \Wjets events
-- an important background to many \ac{SUSY} searches.  Secondly, the \PW
polarisation can be used, along with the methods described in the previous
chapter, to discriminate \ac{SUSY} events from \ac{SM} backgrounds. In the
following sections, a \ac{SUSY} search applying these ideas will be
described~\cite{susy_ra4_pas}.

\section{Distinguishing \acs{SUSY} from \acs{SM} Backgrounds}
\label{sec:susy_sm}
Assuming that \Rparity is conserved, a typical \ac{SUSY} event, with a charged
lepton in the final state, is expected to contain 3 invisible particles: two
\acp{LSP} and a neutrino. As a result, the total \MET in an event will often be
larger than the transverse momentum of the charged lepton and relatively
uncorrelated with it in terms of direction. In contrast, the large boost and
polarisation of a typical \PW decay lead to a more even balance between \METv
and \Ptlv, as well as greater correlation of their directions. These two
consideration can be applied to both \Wjets and \ttbar events -- the two
dominant backgrounds to a single lepton \ac{SUSY} search.

In order to make use of the \PW polarisation effects, this analysis employs the
\LP variable, as described in \sec~\ref{sec:wpol_lp}. For events containing a
charged lepton in association with \MET from the decay of a \PW with large
transverse momentum, the alignment of the charged lepton and neutrino gives an
\LP distribution confined to the range $[0,1]$. In contrast, for \ac{SUSY}
events, the \MET component is often larger than the lepton momentum and thus \PtWv is
likely to point in the direction of \METv. Since the direction of the charged
lepton momentum and \METv will be mostly uncorrelated, \LP will tend to small
values. Rewriting \eqn~\ref{eqn:lp_def},
\begin{equation*}
\LP = \frac{\Ptl}{\PtW}\cos\left(\PtWv, \Ptlv\right),
\end{equation*}
it can be seen that in cases where the angle between the \METv and \Ptlv is more
than 90\degrees, \LP will become negative.

A second important difference between \ac{SUSY} and \ac{SM} events is related to
the overall energy scale. As discussed in \chap~\ref{sec:susy}, \ac{SUSY} decays
are expected to begin with initial states much heavier than in \ac{SM}
events. To provide some measure of this energy scale without biasing the
polarisation, the variable \STlep is constructed as follows,
\begin{equation*}
\STlep = \Ptl + \MET,
\end{equation*}
where it should be noted that \STlep is a scalar quantity. For \PW decays,
$\STlep \approx \PtW$. Since the energy scale of \ac{SUSY} is unknown, \STlep is
used to define search regions. This allows the search to be optimised without
introducing a strong dependence on the energy scale. For the purposes of this
analysis, 4 \STlep bins are employed. These are: $150 < \STlep < 250$, $250 <
\STlep < 350$, $350 < \STlep < 450$ and $\STlep > \unit{450}{\GeV}$. The lowest
of these is taken to be at too low an energy scale to contain \ac{SUSY}
processes not excluded by previous searches. It is thus used as a control region
to validate the analysis method.

\ac{SUSY} cascade decays often give rise to a large number of
jets. Consequently, searches often apply a cut on the jet multiplicity as well
as a cut on the hadronic energy, \HT.

\section{Analysis Method}
The \LP distributions for \ac{SM} backgrounds and two benchmark \ac{SUSY} models
are shown in \fig~\ref{fig:susy_lp}. The benchmark points LM1 and LM6
correspond to the \ac{CMSSM} points $(\Mzero, \Mhalf) = (60, 250)$ and $(85,
400)$ respectively, with $\tanbeta =10$ and $\Azero = 0$. Firstly it can be seen
that the heuristic discussion of the \LP shape given in
\sec~\ref{sec:susy_sm} is confirmed by the simulation -- with \ac{SM} events
at $\LP > 0$ and \ac{SUSY} events clustering around $\LP \sim 0$.

  bins, as measured in \ac{MC}. \ac{SM} background processes are shown along
  with two benchmark \ac{SUSY} models: LM6 and LM1.}
\label{fig:susy_lp}
\end{figure}

In order to make use of the discrimination power afforded by the \LP shape,
signal and control regions are defined. The signal region is defined such that an
enriched sample of \ac{SUSY} events is obtained, without being highly
model-dependent. It should be stressed that the intent is not to eliminate the
background altogether in this region. The control region, likewise, must select
a sample of \ac{SM} background events with sufficient efficiency, whilst
guarding against excessive signal contamination from \ac{SUSY}. By studying the
\LP distribution across the \ac{CMSSM} parameter space, \LPsignal for the signal
region and \LPcontrol for the control region are found to be suitable choices.

To predict the \ac{SM} background contamination in the \LPsignal region, a
translation factor, \RCS is calculated in simulation. This is defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:susysearch_RCS}
\RCS = \frac{N^{\textrm{MC}}(\LPsignal)}{N^{\textrm{MC}}(\LPcontrol)},
\end{equation}
where $N^{\textrm{MC}}(\LPsignal)$ and $N^{\textrm{MC}}(\LPcontrol)$ represent
the population, as calculated in simulation, of \ac{SM} events in the signal and
control regions respectively. Once calculated, \RCS may be used, along with a
measurement from the control region in data, to predict the \ac{SM} background
contribution present in the signal region,
\begin{equation*}
N^{\textrm{data}}(\LPsignal) = \RCS N^{\textrm{data}}(\LPcontrol).
\end{equation*}

In principle it is possible to perform a more, or even completely, data-driven
prediction by performing a template fit to the \LP shape in the control region
and extrapolating into the signal region. This strategy was explored for some
time but found to be infeasible due to the small number of events passing the
selection.

One benefit of using the translation factor, \RCS, is that many systematic
uncertainties should cancel, to some extent, in the ratio. This includes, in
particular, the \ac{JES} uncertainty that proved to be significant for the \PW
polarisation analysis (see \sec~\ref{sec:wpol_syst_jec}). Since these
uncertainties do not cancel completely, they will be fully evaluated in
\sec~\ref{sec:susy_systematics} and are included in the statistical treatment
described in \chap~\ref{sec:interpretation}.

One last point concerning \RCS is that values of $\RCS < 1$ are preferable. This
ensures that the prediction is not dominated by uncertainties stemming from the
limited statistical precision of the control region. As we will see, relatively
small values of \RCS are obtained using the definitions given above.

\section{Object Definitions}
The basic object selection requirements are defined to be consistent between
several complementary leptonic \ac{SUSY} searches at \ac{CMS}. They are
described and motivated further in~\cite{susy_selection_an}.

\subsection{Jets and Missing Energy}
Jets and missing energy quantities are taken from the \ac{PF} algorithm,
as described in \sec~\ref{sec:reco_pf}. In addition, jets are required to
pass the ``LOOSE'' selection criteria, namely:
\begin{itemize}
\item at least two particles -- at least one of them charged -- in the jet;
\item the fraction of jet energy carried by neutral hadrons less than 99\% and
\item charged and neutral electromagnetic fractions both less than 99\%.
\end{itemize}
All jets are required to have a transverse momentum, $\Pt > \unit{40}{\GeV}$ and
must lie within the fiducial region of the tracker, $|\eta| < 2.4$. The total
hadronic transverse energy, \HT is calculated from jets passing this selection.

\subsection{Muons}
Muon reconstruction is described in \sec~\ref{sec:reco_muons}. Global muons are
selected with a number of additional quality requirements. These are similar to
those used in the \PW polarisation analysis (see \sec~\ref{sec:wpol_muons}),
with certain adjustments made to ensure consistency with other \ac{SUSY}
analyses:
\begin{itemize}
\item a normalised $\chi^2 < 10$ on the global muon fit;
\item more than 10 hits in the tracker (including at least 1 pixel hit) and
  $\geq 2$ matching segments in the muon chambers;
\item a transverse distance to the nominal interaction point, $d_0 <
  \unit{200}{\micro\metre}$ and longitudinal distance to the primary vertex $d_z
  < \unit{1}{\centi\metre}$;
\item the uncertainty on the muon transverse momentum $\sigma(\Pt)/\Pt^2 <
  \unit{0.001}{\reciprocal\GeV}$;
\item each global muon must also qualify as a tracker muon and
\item a combined relative isolation (see \eqn~\ref{eqn:wpol_mu_comb_iso}) $\CombIso < 0.1$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Tight} muons are defined by the requirements given above. \textbf{Loose}
muons use an identical selection but with the \CombIso cut loosened to 0.15.

\subsection{Electrons}
\textbf{Tight} electrons are reconstructed as described in
\sec~\ref{sec:reco_electrons} using the 80\% efficiency working point, but with
impact parameter requirements identical to those used for the
muons. \textbf{Loose} electrons use the 95\% efficiency working point, with the
impact parameter criteria loosened as for the muon case.

\subsection{Resolving Ambiguities}
Since the leptons in this analysis use the traditional reconstruction
methods at \ac{CMS} while jets and \METv are taken from the \ac{PF} algorithm,
ambiguities can exist. In order to avoid double counting, these ambiguities are
resolved by several cleaning steps.

To remove jets dominated by a lepton, any jet found within a cone of 0.1 (0.3)
of a selected muon (electron) is removed from consideration. In addition, muons
within a cone of 0.3 of any jet are rejected.

A second step corrects the \METv for differences between \ac{PF} and global muon
reconstruction. Each global muon is matched to a corresponding \ac{PF} muon
within a cone of $\DeltaR < 0.1$. The absolute relative difference between the
transverse momenta is then calculated. For cases where no match is found or this
difference is $> 20\%$, the event is rejected. For cases where the difference is
smaller than 20\%, the \METv receives a vectorial correction.

\section{Analysis Selection}
Selection begins with a set of event cleaning cuts common to many analyses at
\ac{CMS}. These address known detector and reconstruction problems as well as
suppressing machine backgrounds. They are fully detailed
in~\cite{susy_selection_an}.

Lepton selection requires exactly one \textbf{Tight} electron or muon. To remove
dilepton events and minimise overlap with searches in multilepton final states,
events containing a second \textbf{Loose} lepton are vetoed.

After the initial lepton selection cuts, events can enter two independent
samples. The first is a control sample obtained by inverting the jet
multiplicity cut. This selects a sample known to be overwhelmingly dominated by
\ac{SM} backgrounds. To compensate for the inverted jet multiplicity cut, this
sample is selected with a slightly relaxed \HT cut. The second sample is then
used for the actual search. A jet multiplicity cut, $\Njets \geq 3$ is applied,
as well as an $\HT > \unit{500}{\GeV}$ cut.

The data-driven control sample is used to test the analysis techniques before
applying them to the search dataset. During this time, the search dataset was
not studied (or ``blinded'') to avoid changes in the analysis procedure that
might bias the result. Once the analysis method was fully refined, the search
sample was ``unblinded'' and major changes to the analysis were no longer
allowed.

Due to the unavailability of suitable efficient and unbiased triggers, the
control sample is considered only for the muon channel. For the electron
channel, validation work is performed instead in the $150 < \STlep <
\unit{250}{\GeV}$ bin. Trigger thresholds in the control sample necessitated an
increase in the transverse momentum cut applied on the muon to \unit{35}{\GeV}.

The full sequence of selection requirements is shown in
Table~\ref{tbl:susy_cutflow}. The corresponding event yields, as measured in
simulation are shown in Tables~\ref{tbl:susy_mcexp_signal} and
\ref{tbl:susy_mcexp_control} for the signal and control regions respectively.

\input{tables/susy_cutflow}
\input{tables/mc_exp_signal}
\input{tables/mc_exp_control}

\section{Triggers and Datasets}
Due to the construction of \STlep, events may be selected with moderate \MET
(and a large lepton \Pt) or large \MET (and a moderate lepton \Pt). This
necessitates a different trigger strategy to that used in other leptonic
\ac{SUSY} searches at \ac{CMS}, which typically only select high \MET events.

For the search sample, a set of single-lepton ``cross-triggers'' are used,
selecting events with a single lepton in association with a large amount of
hadronic activity, \HT. As the luminosity increased during the 2011 run, it was
necessary to introduce a third requirement: a moderate cut on the \MET.

The full list of triggers used for both lepton search channels and the muon
control sample are shown in Table~\ref{tbl:susy_triggers}. The naming scheme is
similar to that used in \sec~\ref{sec:wpol_triggers}. \texttt{HTX} and
\texttt{PFMHTX} refer to cuts $\HT > \unit{X}{\GeV}$ and particle-flow $\MHT >
\unit{X}{\GeV}$. The string \texttt{CaloId} indicates cuts applied on \HoverE
and \sigmaieta. \texttt{TrkId} uses the angular matching variables: \deltaetain
and \deltaphiin. Similarly, \texttt{CaloIso} and \texttt{TrkIso} select using
the corresponding isolation variables. The suffixes \texttt{VL}, \texttt{L} and
\texttt{T} stand for ``very-loose'', ``loose'' and ``tight'' respectively -
referring to the ``tightness'' of the cut applied to the concerned quantity. The
\texttt{VL} selection requirements are broadly comparable to the
\texttt{CaloEleId} and \texttt{TightEleId} triggers used for the \PW
polarisation analysis. The \texttt{T} requirements are looser than the 80\%
efficiency working point. All trigger requirements are chosen to be looser than
the offline selection.

\input{tables/susy_triggers}

All signal and background \ac{MC} samples are from the Summer11 \ac{CMS}
\unit{7}{\TeV} production using \cmssw version 4.2. All processes are simulated
using the \madgraph matrix element generator, with the exception of the \ac{QCD}
and \ac{SUSY} signal samples which use \pythia version 6. All datasets, with the
exception of the \ac{SUSY} signal scan used to derive the limit, make use of the
full detector simulation. The \ac{SUSY} signal scan uses the \fastsim simplified
simulation package to reduce processing time. All samples contain data-like
pile-up conditions, with a re-weighting procedure used throughout to reflect the
vertex multiplicity distribution in data.

In addition to the standard \Wjets sample, an enriched sample with a
generator-level $\HT > \unit{300}{\GeV}$ cut is used. The larger event sample
reduces the statistical error on \RCS.

\section{Control Region}
In order to test that the simulation of \ac{EWK} background processes can be
relied upon for the calculation of the translation factor \RCS, the procedure is
first performed in the control sample. With the jet multiplicity cut inverted,
any supersymmetry signal should be highly diluted in this sample. It is expected
therefore that the background prediction in the signal region should agree well
with the observed signal yield. Furthermore, the level of agreement between data
and simulation is also important in establishing the method.

A summary of the yields in the \LPcontrol and \LPsignal regions in the $<3$~jet
control sample is given in Table~\ref{tbl:susy_control_yields}. The yields for
each \ac{SM} subprocess are shown, used to calculate the factor \RCS, as well as
the yields in data and the resulting background prediction. The background
prediction is seen to agree, within errors, with the observed number of events
in the signal region. The uncertainties stem from the limited population of the
control region and the limited \ac{MC} sample used in the calculation of \RCS.

\input{tables/susy_control_yields}

Comparisons of the variables \STlep, \MT and \Ptmu between data and simulation
are shown in \fig~\ref{fig:susy_mucontrol_kin}. A similar comparison is shown
for the \LP variable, in bins of \STlep, in
\fig~\ref{fig:susy_mucontrol_lp}. These distributions are those used to derive
the numbers shown in Table~\ref{tbl:susy_control_yields}. The data are seen to
be adequately described by the simulation.

\end{figure}

\section{Background Prediction}
As for the \PW polarisation analysis, the background from \ac{QCD} multi-jet
events again presents a difficulty. In the muon channel, the \ac{QCD}
contribution is once again small-to-negligible as evidenced by
Table~\ref{tbl:susy_mcexp_control}. Therefore, it is sufficient to calculate
only an upper bound. For the electron channel, as before, the contribution is
much larger. Fortunately, the methods outlined in
\sec~\ref{sec:wpol_data_driven_bg} prove to be effective again, with some
modification.

\subsection{Muons}
A conservative upper limit on the \ac{QCD} background in the muon channel is
obtained from a data-driven control sample defined by an isolation requirement,
$0.2 < \CombIso < 0.5$. In order to further enrich \ac{QCD} events, whilst
suppressing \ac{EWK} backgrounds in this sample, a cut, $\MET <
\unit{20}{\GeV}$, is also applied. Even with these cuts, significant \ac{EWK}
contamination remains. The significance of the vertex impact parameter is used
as an additional handle, by requiring $\sigma(\D0) > 3$. By selecting muons
displaced from the primary vertex, backgrounds from hadron decays are
enhanced~\cite{ttbar_paper_cms}. The ratio $N(\CombIso < 0.1)/N(0.2 < \CombIso <
0.5)$ in this sample is then used to derive an upper limit on the \ac{QCD}
contribution. This limit is conservative given that \ac{EWK} backgrounds are
present in the ratio. The \ac{QCD} background is found to be negligible in all
\STlep bins and is ignored in the subsequent analysis.

\subsection{Electrons}
\label{sec:susy_electron_bgpredict}
In the case of the electrons, a strategy similar to that used in the \PW
polarisation analysis is employed. As before, the electron identification
variables \deltaetain and \deltaphiin are inverted. In addition, to ensure
adequate statistical precision, the \D0 and \Dz cuts are removed and the
isolation cut is relaxed. The \D0 and \Dz cuts were not present in the \PW
polarisation selection. Although the present analysis benefits from a dataset
$\sim 30$ times larger than that used for the previous measurement, this
increase is partly offset by generally tighter kinematic cuts.

In addition, it was observed during measurement of the \PW polarisation that the
shape of the QCD template is affected by a cut on \PtW. Thus it should be
assumed to depend too on \STlep, necessitating the use of independent templates
for each \STlep bin. A comparison of the selected and anti-selected shapes in
simulated \ac{QCD} events is shown in \fig~\ref{fig:susy_elqcd_selasel}. This
may be compared with those derived in the \PW polarisation analysis (see
\fig~\ref{fig:wpol_ele_sel_antisel}). Differences may be accounted for by the
modified electron selection and kinematic cuts.

As in the \PW polarisation analysis, a binned maximum likelihood fit is
performed, using templates for the \ac{EWK} backgrounds derived from
simulation. To avoid the potential effects of \ac{SUSY} signal contamination,
the fit region is restricted to \LPcontrol and the fit-result is extrapolated
into \LPsignal. The results of these fits are shown in
\fig~\ref{fig:susy_elqcd}. The predictions of the \ac{QCD} and \ac{EWK}
background contamination can be seen in
Table~\ref{tbl:susy_datamc_electrons}. The \ac{QCD} contamination in the signal
region is found to be negligible.

The results of the fit can be used to directly predict the background
contamination in the signal region. However, in order to compare systematic
uncertainties with the muon channel, \RCS values are calculated from the results
of the fit. The systematic uncertainties are then evaluated in terms of their
effect on \RCS. For the limit procedure described in
\chap~\ref{sec:interpretation}, it is technically simpler to use the fit results
to correct the control region yield in order to subtract the \ac{QCD}
contribution. Since the \ac{QCD} contamination in the signal region is
negligible, this does not make a significant difference to the limit.

In summary, the \ac{QCD} contamination in the electron channel is accounted for
by taking the background prediction in the signal region from the fitted number
of \ac{EWK} and \ac{QCD} events. The additional uncertainties introduced by this
procedure will be covered in \sec~\ref{sec:susy_systematics}.

\section{Systematic Uncertainties}
\label{sec:susy_systematics}
For this analysis, as with the \PW polarisation measurement, unavoidable
dependence on simulation requires careful evaluation of associated systematic
uncertainties. It has already been said that the construction of \RCS is
intended to minimise some of these uncertainties by ensuring some degree of
cancellation. Experience from the \PW polarisation measurement showed that the
\LP variable is highly sensitive to certain uncertainties -- in particular the
\ac{JES}. The size of these uncertainties was thus evaluated early-on in the
development of the analysis and continued throughout. Several of the procedures
for evaluating systematic uncertainties were adopted or adapted from those used
for the previous measurement (see \sec~\ref{sec:wpol_systematics}).

The background prediction may be written as follows,
\begin{equation*}
\NBkgi = \RCSi \times \NControli,
\end{equation*}
where \NBkgi is the predicted background for \LPsignal in \STlep bin $i$, \RCSi
the corresponding translation factor and \NControli the yield in the region
\LPcontrol.

The uncertainty assigned to the background prediction, \NBkg, comes from two
sources: uncertainty on the translation factor, \RCS, and uncertainty on the
yield in the control region, \NControl. These uncertainties will now be
described.

\subsection{Control Region \texorpdfstring{\LPcontrol}{\LPcontrolBM}}
A statistical uncertainty must be included to account for the finite event yield
in the control region. The effect is naturally more pronounced in the higher
\STlep bins. For the muon channel, this is simply calculated as the Poisson
uncertainty on the number of events in the control region. For electrons, this
is taken as the uncertainty on the \ac{EWK} component of the background as
determined from the fit (see \sec~\ref{sec:susy_electron_bgpredict}).

\subsection{\acl{MC} Statistical Uncertainty}
\label{sec:susy_syst_mcstats}
The limited number of simulated events results in a systematic uncertainty on
the calculation of \RCS for both lepton channels. This is calculated by simple
propagation of errors.

For the electron channel, things are once again complicated by the \ac{QCD}
fitting procedure. The \ac{EWK} templates used in the fit are taken from finite
\ac{MC} samples. This results in an additional source of uncertainty on the
background prediction. This is accounted for in a similar manner to the
statistical uncertainty of the \ac{QCD} template in the \PW polarisation
analysis (see \sec~\ref{sec:wpol_syst_ele_bgest}). The templates are randomly
fluctuated 200 times according to the statistical uncertainty per bin. Each
re-diced template is then used to repeat the fit procedure. The variance of this
ensemble of fits is then taken to be the statistical uncertainty. For the
systematic uncertainty quoted in Table~\ref{tbl:susy_syst_electrons}, this is
propagated into \RCS. For the limit, as will be seen, it is taken as an
uncertainty on \NControl.

\subsection{\acl{JES}}
\label{sec:susy_jes_uncertainty}
This procedure was changed with respect to the \PW polarisation measurement in
order to harmonise with other analyses. Each jet in the event, as well as the
remaining hadronic recoil are scaled upwards or downwards by 5\%. The larger of
the two shifts on \RCS is then taken as the uncertainty. If the uncertainty is
found to be smaller than the \ac{MC} statistical uncertainty
(\sec~\ref{sec:susy_syst_mcstats}), the larger of the two is assigned.

\subsection{\MET Resolution}
\label{sec:susy_metres_uncertainty}
As for the \PW polarisation measurement, the \MET resolution measured in data is
seen to be 10\% larger than predicted by simulation~\cite{cms_met_paper,
  cms_met_pas}. To account for this, the recoil is smeared by an additional 10\%
perpendicular and parallel to its direction. The resulting shift in \RCS is
taken as the uncertainty. As for the \PW polarisation case, this is a
conservative estimate.

\subsection[\texorpdfstring{\Wjets}{W+jets} and \texorpdfstring{\ttbar}{tt}
Backgrounds]{\boldmath{\Wjets} and \boldmath{\ttbar} Backgrounds}
The use of \RCS avoids any dependence on the absolute values of theoretical
cross-sections. However, since the \Wjets and \ttbar backgrounds have different
shapes in \LP, changes to their relative normalisations will result in changes
to \RCS. To account for this, the \ttbar and \Wjets contributions are each
scaled up and down by 30\% and 50\% respectively. The former is again taken from
a cross-section measurement at \ac{CMS}~\cite{cms_ttbar_paper2} (improved with
respect to that cited in the \PW polarisation measurement). The latter is
evaluated by studying the agreement between data and \ac{MC} in \Zjets events
with $\geq 4$~jets. The difference is found to be at most 50\%.

The shift in \RCS with respect to the unscaled case is then calculated. The
shifts are performed simultaneously to give the most extreme change in \RCS,
i.e. one background is shifted up, the other down. The largest such shift is
taken as the uncertainty. As for the jet energy scale, a shift smaller than the
statistical uncertainty of the simulated sample is taken to be the statistical
uncertainty. Additionally, the uncertainty is calculated simultaneously for both
lepton channels, in order to maximis the statistical precision.

\subsection{Muon Momentum Scale}
Studies of the \PZ mass indicate a bias of 1\%~\cite{cms_mu_pas}. To estimate
this effect, the muon momentum is varied as follows~\cite{susy_ra4_pas}:
\begin{equation*}
\Ptmu' = \Ptmu + \textrm{sign}(\mu) \times 0.01 {\Ptmu}^2/\unit{100}{\GeV} \times (1+\sin(\phi)).
\end{equation*}

\subsection[\texorpdfstring{\PW}{W} and \texorpdfstring{\ttbar}{tt} Polarisation]{\boldmath{\PW} and \boldmath{\ttbar} Polarisation}
The polarisation in \ttbar events is 5\%. Since the effect on \RCS is less than
5\%, this is assigned as a conservative uncertainty.

For the \PW polarisation, the errors on the previous measurement are taken and
used to assign a 15\% uncertainty to the difference of the left-handed and
right-handed fractions, \fLmfR (see \sec~\ref{sec:wpol_results}). To account for
this, the simulation is re-weighted to reflect an upward and downard shift of
15\% on \fLmfR with respect to the nominal values. This is done in a manner
similar to that used for the actual measurement (see
\sec~\ref{sec:wpol_reweighting}), but using 5 bins in \PtW instead of 3. The
effect is shown for the lowest and highest \STlep bins in
\fig~\ref{fig:susy_wpol_syst}. The largest of the two shifts is taken to be the
systematic uncertainty.

\subsection[Fully Leptonic \texorpdfstring{\ttbar}{tt}]{Fully Leptonic \ttbar}
The fraction of events passing the selection in which a second lepton is not
identified, either due to reconstruction or acceptance effects, is estimated in
simulation. Since this is a relatively small fraction of the background, a
conservative 50\% uncertainty is assumed. The resulting change in the \LP shape
is then propagated into \RCS.

\subsection{\aclp{PDF}}
The systematic uncertainty due to the choice of \ac{PDF} was previously
evaluated for the \PW polarisation analysis (see
\sec~\ref{sec:wpol_syst_pdf}). It was found to be negligible. For this
analysis, an alternative test was performed.

The \ac{MC} is reweighted to the central value of both
\cteqsixtysix and \mstwnlo \ac{PDF}
sets~\cite{cteq66,mstw1,mstw2,mstw3}. The resulting change in \RCS is found to be 1\%
for $\STlep < \unit{450}{\GeV}$ and 5\% for $\STlep > \unit{450}{\GeV}$.

\subsection{Trigger Efficiency}
The exact selection of triggers listed in Table~\ref{tbl:susy_triggers} was
unavailable in the \ac{MC} samples. Small differences in the efficiency in
the plateau of the trigger turn-on curve are observed in both channels as well
as a dependence on the pseudorapidity of the lepton. The effect of these
differences is evaluated by applying the \texttt{HLT\_Mu15} trigger in
simulation. The effect on \RCS is found to be $<1\%$ across all $\eta$ bins.

% Whilst the efficiencies of the trigger are found to be uncorrelated with the
% lepton \Pt, an $\eta$ dependence is observed. This variation is found to be 18\%
% in the muon channel and 5\% in the electron channel. In addition, at the plateau
% of the trigger turn-on curve, a difference of efficiency between data and
% simulation is observed: 5\% in the muon channel and $\approx 1\%$ for
% electrons. To estimate the combined effect of the $\eta$ dependence and the
% discrepancy between data and Monte Carlo, the HLT\_Mu15 trigger is applied in
% simulation. The effect on \RCS is seen to be $<1\%$ across all $\eta$ bins.

\subsection{Summary}
The relative uncertainties on \RCS for each significant systematic effect listed
above are shown in Table~\ref{tbl:susy_syst_muons} for the muon channel and
\ref{tbl:susy_syst_electrons} for the electron channel. In the highest \STlep
bins, the limited statistical precision of the control region is seen to be the
dominant source of systematic uncertainty for both lepton channels. The second
largest source of uncertainty (and the largest in some bins), is due to the
\ac{JES}. This was also a significant source of uncertainty in the \PW
polarisation analysis, and therefore is expected.

\section{Results}
Once the analysis procedure had been finalised, the search region was
``unblinded''. The \LP distributions in data, along with the expected shapes in
\ac{MC} are shown in \fig~\ref{fig:susy_datamc}, for the three \STlep bins
considered for the search. The predicted and observed background yields are then
shown in Table~\ref{tbl:susy_datamc_muons} for muons and
\ref{tbl:susy_datamc_electrons} for electrons. Comparison of the predicted and
observed numbers are shown graphically in \fig~\ref{fig:susy_pred}. It is clear,
that no significant excess is seen. In the next chapter, the results are used to
set limits on allowed parameter space for the \ac{CMSSM} and more general
simplified models.
