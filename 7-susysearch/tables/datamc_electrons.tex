caption=Event yields in data and predictions of the numbers of EWK and QCD
events for the electron search sample with $\geq 3$ jets and $\HT >
\unit{500}{\GeV}$. The sum of predicted EWK events and predicted QCD events in
the control region is constrained to be equal to the total number of data
events. The background estimate which is used in comparing to the yields in the
data is the result of the procedure described earlier and is listed in the row
labeled ``SM estimate''. The uncertainty shown for the SM estimate are the full
systematic uncertainties. The uncertainties shown for the EWK and QCD
contributions are only the statistical uncertainties from the predictions.,
